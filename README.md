# 🧠 Headscale + Headplane + Traefik Setup

A simple installer for **Headscale**, **Headplane**, and **Traefik** — running in Docker.  
Automatically sets up HTTPS (via Let’s Encrypt), generates API keys, configures the UI, and more.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Install

```bash
sudo chmod +x install-headscale.sh
sudo ./install-headscale.sh
```

During installation, you’ll be prompted for:

> Domain (e.g., headscale.example.com)
> Email (for Let’s Encrypt SSL)

The installer will build all configs, start Headscale, Traefik, and Headplane, and display your API key at the end.
Uninstall

```bash
sudo chmod +x uninstall-headscale.sh
sudo ./uninstall-headscale.sh
```

This script will stop containers, remove volumes, delete configs/data, and optionally prune unused Docker resources.
🌐 Access

    Headscale API: https://your-domain.com

    Headplane Web UI: https://your-domain.com/admin

Your API Key is displayed at the end of install and also saved to headscale/.env.

✅ Working Configuration (Image Versions)

Here are the versions confirmed working in this setup:

headplane:
  image: 'ghcr.io/tale/headplane:0.6.1'

headscale:
  image: 'headscale/headscale:v0.26.1'

traefik:
  image: 'traefik:v3.5.3'

You can pin these in your docker-compose.yaml to avoid surprises from latest tags.
🔍 Verify Running Versions

To see what images and tags are running:

docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}"
docker images

To query the version inside a container (if supported):

docker exec headscale headscale version
docker exec headplane <version or help command>
docker exec traefik traefik version

You can also inspect metadata:

docker inspect <image-name>:<tag> | grep -i version

🛠️ Troubleshooting

    View logs:

docker logs -f headscale
docker logs -f headplane
docker logs -f traefik

Restart services:

    docker compose -f headscale/docker-compose.yaml restart

    Use Traefik middlewares or PathPrefixStrip if you want Headplane behind /admin on the same domain.

🧩 License & Notes

This setup script is free to use and adapt.
Headscale, Headplane, and Traefik are each under their own open-source licenses — check their docs.
Pinning versions (instead of latest) is recommended for stability.
